# remark-highlight.js

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use `remark-rehype` to move from remark (markdown) to rehype (HTML)
and then replace `remark-highlight.js` with
[`rehype-highlight`][rehype-highlight].

Legacy [documentation for this package](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-highlight.js/tree/8d4895e)
is still available in Git.
